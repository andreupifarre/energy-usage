Time:
-It took me 2 hours to do the task 1, since I had to integrate testing tools.
-Task 2 took me 2 more hours since I wanted to make sure the results were correct, so I had to represent the results in paper.

Notes:
I have applied Linear Interpolation for caclulating the usage at the end of the current month and I substracted the usage at the end of the previous month, giving me the approximate usage for that month.
